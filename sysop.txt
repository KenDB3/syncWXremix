--------------------

I) Getting a Wunderground API Key

You can get your API key for Wunderground here: http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/

I originally signed up for Stratus Plan because I thought that was the only free one, 
turns out all three are free, it just costs money for more than 500 hits per day. 
Sign up for at least Cumulus Plan to make sure you are getting the Severe Alerts 
(which I am somehow still getting with the lower Stratus Plan but I'll probably upgrade too).

--------------------

II) External Program Configuration

Setting up the Weather App (weather.js):

1: If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the
   folder "syncWX" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncWX/). 

2: Open up weather.js in a text editor like Notepad++

3: Find the following code on line 9
       var wungrndAPIkey = "xxxxx";
   Replace xxxxx with your API Key

4: Find the following code on line 17
       var weathericon_ext = ".asc"
   If you have added custom weather icons, make sure the file extension matches this variable
   Example: The app comes with .ASC icons, if you changed to .ANS icons, you would put
       var weathericon_ext = ".ans"
   Otherwise, if you did not change the icons that came with syncWXremix, then leave this line alone
   
--If you host your own my.ftelnet.ca (HTMLTerm/HTML5) web socket proxy, you will want to follow steps 5 & 6
--otherwise you can ignore steps 3 & 4 entirely

5: Find the following code on line 38
       if (user.ip_address != "192.168.1.100") {
    Replace 192.168.1.100 with the local (LAN) IP of your BBS machine 
	or whatever local IP is running your web socket proxy

6: Find the following code on line 41
	   var weather_ip_address = "8.8.8.8";
	Replace 8.8.8.8 with the Public IP of your BBS
	or whatever public IP you want to use as a default for GeoIP lookups that generate the location

7: Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

Setting up the main door (weather.js):

[weather.js]
 1: Name                       Your Local Weather
 2: Internal Code              SYNCWX
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?weather.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No

Setting up Icon Viewer:

The purpose of the iconset.js script is to see the icon files that have been designed for 
your syncWXremix app quickly and in total. This way, if you are designing your own
icon pack for the weather, you can make sure that 1) the icons look good, and 
2) you are not missing any of the icons you would need. 

Note: This is not meant to be seen by anyone but a sysop, so the access requirement
is set to LEVEL 90 (or above).

[iconset.js]
 1: Name                       View Icon Set
 2: Internal Code              WTHRICON
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?iconset.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        LEVEL 90
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
