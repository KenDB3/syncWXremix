--------------------

I) Getting a Wunderground API Key

You can get your API key for Wunderground here: http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/

I originally signed up for Stratus Plan because I thought that was the only free one, 
turns out all three are free, it just costs money for more than 500 hits per day. 
Sign up for at least Cumulus Plan to make sure you are getting the Severe Alerts 
(which I am somehow still getting with the lower Stratus Plan but I'll probably upgrade too).

--------------------

II) External Program Configuration

Setting up the Weather App (weather.js):

1: If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the
   folder "syncWX" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncWX/). 

2: Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[syncWX]
wungrndAPIkey = <your API key here>
weathericon_ext = .asc
fallback_type = bbsip
fallback = 

Change the entry for "wungrndAPIkey = <your API key here>" by adding your API Key from Section I. 
	Example:
	wungrndAPIkey = 123456789abc1234

NOTE: No quotes are needed in the modopts.ini section you added. 
This step is now different than version 1.00, where you entered the key directly into the weather.js file. 
This makes updates to the weather.js file easier, since you don't have to edit the javascript each time an update lands.

3: If you have added custom weather icons, make sure the file extension matches in the weathericon_ext variable in modopts.ini
   Example: The app comes with .ASC icons, if you changed to .ANS icons, you would put
       weathericon_ext = .ans
   Otherwise, if you did not change the icons that came with syncWXremix, then keep the default modopts.ini entry of 
       weathericon_ext = .asc

4: The entry for "fallback_type" can be set to: 
		nonip
		bbsip
a) nonip - Choosing this means you must set the entry for "fallback" to either a 
           United States Postal ZIP Code, an ICAO Airport Code, or an IATA Airport Code.
		   Note: ICAO Airport Codes seem more specific and less likely to error out. 
		   
		   See this link for ICAO Airport Codes:
		   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_airport_code#Prefixes
		   
		   See this link for IATA Airport Codes:
		   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code
		   
			-Example with US Postal ZIP for Beverly Hills, CA:
				fallback_type = nonip
				fallback = 90210

			-Example with ICAO Airport Code for Providence, RI:
				fallback_type = nonip
				fallback = KPVD
			
b) bbsip - weather.js will automatically grab the public IP address of your BBS.
           In this case, "fallback" does not need to be set to anything. 
   
5: Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

Setting up the main door (weather.js):

[weather.js]
 1: Name                       Your Local Weather
 2: Internal Code              SYNCWX
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?weather.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No (or "Logon" or "Logon, Only", it is up to you)
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

Setting up Icon Viewer:

The purpose of the iconset.js script is to see the icon files that have been designed for 
your syncWXremix app quickly and in total. This way, if you are designing your own
icon pack for the weather, you can make sure that 1) the icons look good, and 
2) you are not missing any of the icons you would need. 

Note: This is not meant to be seen by anyone but a sysop, so the access requirement
is set to LEVEL 90 (or above). Also, the icon extension is set just like in weather.js, where
it grabs the extension from /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini.

[iconset.js]
 1: Name                       View Icon Set
 2: Internal Code              WTHRICON
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/syncWX/
 4: Command Line               ?iconset.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        LEVEL 90
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...
